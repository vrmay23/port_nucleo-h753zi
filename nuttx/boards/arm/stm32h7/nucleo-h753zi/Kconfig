config NUCLEO_H753ZI_LEDS_AUTO
	bool "Automatic LEDs (Kernel controlled)"
	---help---
		LEDs are automatically controlled by the kernel to indicate
		system status (boot stages, interrupts, panics, etc.).
		The LEDs will show:
		- GREEN: System ready, signals
		- ORANGE: Heap allocation, IRQs  
		- RED: Assertions, panics, idle
		
		NOTE: You still need to manually enable:
		Board Selection → Board LED Status support

	select BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE
	---help---
		LEDs are controlled by user applications via /dev/userleds.
		Applications can turn individual LEDs on/off as needed.
		Kernel status indication is disabled.
		
		NOTE: You must manually disable:
		Board Selection → Board LED Status support (to avoid conflicts)
config NUCLEO_H753ZI_LEDS_DISABLED
	bool "LEDs disabled"
	---help---
		LED functionality is completely disabled to save resources.
		
		NOTE: You should manually disable:
		Board Selection → Board LED Status support
