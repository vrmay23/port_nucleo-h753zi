		Download and prepare Xedge IoT Toolkit dependencies (BAS and BAS-Resources).
		
		Xedge is an embedded software toolkit designed to enable high-level developers
		(e.g., web and Lua programmers) to create sophisticated, secure IoT and industrial
		device applications. It abstracts low-level embedded development through a lightweight
		runtime built on top of the Barracuda App Server and Lua.

		This option will download the required Barracuda App Server and BAS-Resources
		repositories during the build process, making them available for applications
		that want to use Xedge.

		After enabling this, you can use the examples/xedge_demo as a reference
		for integrating Xedge into your own applications.
